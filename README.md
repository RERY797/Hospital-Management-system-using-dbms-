# Hospital-Management-system-using-dbms-
Organisations such as hospitals have to deal with a lot of patients regularly and hence a lot of data. Hence it is very important for a hospital to have a DBMS with a frontend that easily allows patients to book appointments and allows doctors or administrators to manage patient data.
For this project I have chosen to build the frontend using ReactJS and JavaScript, backend in Node.js and the database used will be MySQL.
